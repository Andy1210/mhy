# `mhy`?

> Out-of-the box development environment.

`mhy` \(my\) is supposed to be a development/production environment/compiler/ecosystem _out-of-the_ box. I just simply had enough of having multiple instances of the same npm packages on my machine, and the need to setup a development environment each time I start a new project.

I hate the need to configure a bunch of configs/scripts, the need to open up multiple terminals and start commands separately. I hate that I always have to align different configs to be able to start development \(like Babel for Webpack, Jest and Storybook\).

This is `mhy` own development environment, how I like it and/or want it to be, instantly, anywhere, simply.

# Supported tools

`mhy` is providing many common/popular packages out-of the box. There are continuous adjustments being made to the includes to match the most common needs and being able to develop without the need of your own `npm install` command ever again. The best is to check the dependencies of our `package.json` for the included packages, and I also advice you to check out our sources for more details.

# Credits & Contributors ‚ù§

I'm using Webpack's logo to build an `M` shape from multiple blocks. I'd like to thank you for their great logo.

I also would like to thank to every developer's hard work which I'm using as dependency. It would be really hard to collect all those people, but in case you find your work in our `package.json`, please feel free to create a pull request and add your logo here (128x128, 5 cell per row):
