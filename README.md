# Introduction
MHY (my) is suppose to be a development/production environment/compiler
 out-of the box. I just simply had enough of having multiple
instances of the same npm packages on my machine, the need to setup
a development environment,
the need to configure a bunch of stuff, the need to store my scripts
online somewhere if I want to quickly test something, the need to open
up multiple terminals and start commands separately.
This is MHY development environment, how I like it/want it to be,
instantly, anywhere, simply (or it's goal least...)
